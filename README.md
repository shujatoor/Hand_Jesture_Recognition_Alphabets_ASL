# Hand_Gesture_Recognition_Alphabets_ASL
This code recognizes Alphabets in American Sign Language (ASL) for the deaf. 
I have used opencv and mediapipe library for hand landmarks detection. 
The code saves these landmarsks in a csv file. 
Then the data was used to train a deep learning model in Tensorflow.
Use Hands_Tracking_and_Data_Collection.ipynb file to collect the data, check the  labels_for_alphabets.txt for alphabet labels'
Use Jestures_Training.ipynb to train the model
Use the file Alphabets_Jesture_Detection.ipynb for detection and recognition
